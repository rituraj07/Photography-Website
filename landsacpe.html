    <h4 class="card-title">Maximize Depth of Field</h4>
    <p class="card-text">In landscape photography the most important thing maximum depth of field 
    which means that most of the elements in your shot should be in focus .
    For that you need to set a small aperture.  The simplest way to do this is to choose a small Aperture setting (a large f number) as the smaller your aperture the greater the depth of field in your shots. Do keep in mind that smaller apertures mean less light is hitting your image sensor at any point in time so they will mean you need to compensate either by increasing your ISO or lengthening your shutter speed (or both).

    <h4 class="card-title">Use a Tripod</h4>
    <p class="card-text"> As you need to set longer shutter speed so that you can compensate for a small aperture you will need to find a way of ensuring your camera is completely still during the exposure. Some people are good at taking shots at longer shutter speed but tripod can be beneficial. Also consider a cable or wireless shutter release mechanism for extra camera stillness so that the camera is not disturbed while taking shot.</p>

It is not mandatory to have a tripod and a photographer must be ready for taking any shot without wasting time. So practice to take pictures of longer shutter speed with steady hands.</p>

    <h4 class="card-title">Look for a Focal Point</h4>
    <p class="card-text">It is necassery to have a focal point an any shot so that viewer can catch the  
    image otherwise they will rest their  eyes and they will generally move on quickly. Focal points can take many forms in landscapes and could range from a building or structure, a striking tree, a boulder or rock formation, a silhouette etc. Think not only about what the focal point is but where you place it. The rule of thirds might be useful here.</p>

    <h4 class="card-title">Think Foregrounds</h4>
    <p class="card-text">In landscape photography a large scene is covered and foreground is main part of it so think about foregroung wisely. When you do this you give those viewing the shot a way into the image as well as creating a sense of depth in your shot.</p>

 Normally foreground is in bottom of an image so foreground gives image an strong base.</p>

    <h4 class="card-title">Work with the Weather</h4>
    <p class="card-text">From a photographer’s point of view there is no such thing as bad weather – if it’s sunny then beaches look good, if it’s cloudy then rainforest images look great. Best of all, if it’s really stormy there is the potential for great images because good skies can make or break a photo.Images with great cloud formations will almost always look better than the same shot with a plain blue sky. When storms clear and pass over then you can get really atmospheric light. </p>

    <h4 class="card-title">Work the Golden Hours</h4>
    <p class="card-text">The golden hour refers to the period just after sunrise or just before sunset, and its length depends on where you are, what time of year it is, and the weather conditions.
    Portraits and landscapes benefit the most from this special light, so we’ll break the tips down between those two categories. Like most photography tips and techniques, once you have the hang of them, you can apply them to less obvious situations – e.g., you can apply the portraiture tips to landscapes and the like.</p>
